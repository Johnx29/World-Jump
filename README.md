# Platformer-Game-PyGame
This game was created for my capstone project assignment which I decided on creating a platformer game using the PyGame library.
## Goals
I hope to finish the basic mechanics of the platformer game and include interesting features that make this game more distinctive then other platformer games.
## Technology Used
The technology I used was python with the pygame library which has all the code needed to setup a basic game which allows me to develop the game without worrying about specific game engine features to add.
