# World Jumo
This game was created for my ICS4U capstone project assignment and I decided to make a platformer game using the Pygame library.
## Goals
The goal is to finish the player movement and have a screen show Play to start the game.
## Technology Used
The technology and libraries used include Pygame, os library, PyTMX, and Tiled
